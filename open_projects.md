#### Share and collaborate your Eureqa code ####
Do you have a useful program, example code, or other utilities using the Eureqa API?

#### Expand the Eureqa API to another program or language ####
Can you write C++ wrappers for another program or language? For example, calling the Eureqa API from Matlab, Mathematica, R, Python, and other environments could be extremely useful for many other developers.
