Eureqa API Installation:
------------------------

The Eureqa API is a header-only library - meaning it does not need 
to be compiled. The base Eureqa API directory just needs to be 
added to the include path of your project or compiler.

If you unzipped the API to "c:\", you should now have a directory 
at "c:\eureqa_api_1_00_0\". This is your root Eureqa API path; add
it to your include path.

You should now be able to include the Eurqa headers using:

#include <eureqa/eureqa.h>

A detailed, step-by-step, setup guide is available for windows, linux, and mac at:

    http://code.google.com/p/eureqa-api/

Eureqa also requires the Boost C++ Libraries with compiled binaries.
You can obtain Boost at http://www.boost.org/
